# Sentiment_modifier
This project was inspired by Google's Natural Language API, Natural Language Programming (NLP). The project harnesses the power of the analysis of the sentiments of the text of the NLP API that helps us determine the rate of positivity or negativity of a given statement or a dialogue. Apart from the ability to segregate and classify the positive, neutral, and negative text sentiments, our software tool, The Sentiment Modifier, can alter the sentiment of the text from negative to positive, negative to neutral, neutral to positive, and so on. The next steps in progressing with the project would involve incorporating additional features that can filter out the actions that tend to convert sentiments (positive/neutral/negative) into statements of negative sentiment. 

# Vision 
The vision of this project is to begin with embedding this software tool on social media platforms, a ubiquitous platform where millions of texts and dialogues are exchanged on a day-to-day basis. In a world that is dependent and emersed in technological advancements, it is important to protect the public from hate and/or negative comments and this project embarks an initial step towards solving this niche issue. The software tool when embedded on the social media platform automatically or manually can be activated when the user is on the social media platform, so that when any text is being exchanged, there is no risk of harmful or aggressive comments negatively impacting the user and vice versa.
